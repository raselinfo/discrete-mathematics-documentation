# Discrete Mathematics 🔥

## 1. Introduction

> <b>Discrete mathematics is the branch of mathematics dealing with object that can assume only distinct, separated values</b>

## 2. Propositional

> <b>A propositional is a declarative statement that is either true(T) or false(F), but not both.</b>

- Example ✍️  
  2 + 2 = 4 (Truth value of this proposition : T)  
  4 + 5 = 10 (Truth value of this proposition : F)  
  Chandpur is the capital of Bangladesh (Truth value of this proposition : F)  
  Pigs can Fly (Truth value of this proposition : F)

### ➡️ Not Proposition (Not valid logical arguments):

- What time is it? (Questions)
- Read this carefully. (Command / Imperative)
- Do your homework. (Command / Imperative)
- X + 1 = 2. (Non constant value, X is undefined)
- Bangladesh and India. (Not statements)
- Shin is the best lecturer. (Opinion)
- He is a college student. (Person is undefined)

> <i>So, Questions, Command, undefined value, Not statements , Opinion are not valid logical arguments or Not Proposition</i>

### ➡️ Propositional variables / Statement variables

- p = Today is Friday. (p is propositional variables p could be false of true)
- q = It is raining (Q is propositional variables , q could be true or false)

### ➡️ Compound Proposition

> <b>Compound proposition is proposition formed by combining tow or more simple proposition  
> Connectives : The logical operators that are used to form compound proposition is called connectives</b>

| Symbol     |          Math Name           |        English Name |
| ---------- | :--------------------------: | ------------------: |
| <b> ¬ </b> |           Negation           |                 NOT |
| <b> ∨ </b> |         Disjunction          |                  OR |
| <b>∧</b>   |         Conjunction          |                 AND |
| <b>⊕</b>   |             ExOR             | "OR...but not both" |
| <b>⇒</b>   |         Implication          |         "if...then" |
| <b>⟺</b>   | Equivalence / bicondiotional |      "if & only if" |

<h2> Example of connectives </h2>
<b> 1. NOT (¬)</b>

> "Today is Friday" negation of this sentence is "Today is not Friday" or <b> ¬Today is not Friday </b>
